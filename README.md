It uses a BitmapShader and does not:

- create a copy of the original bitmap
- use a clipPath (which is neither hardware accelerated nor anti-aliased)
- use setXfermode to clip the bitmap (which means drawing twice to the canvas)

As this is just a custom ImageView and not a custom Drawable or a combination of both, it can be used with all kinds of drawables, i.e. a PicassoDrawable from Picasso or other non-standard drawables (needs some testing though).



## How to:
- gradle

Add the JitPack repository to your build file.
Add this in your root `settings.gradle` file (**not** your module `build.gradle` file):

```gradle

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_SETTINGS)
    repositories {
    ....
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}
```

Then, add the library to your module `build.gradle`

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.samyak2403:CircleImageView:(letest Release)'
}
```


```xml
<com.samyak2403.CircleImageView
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/profile_image"
    android:layout_width="96dp"
    android:layout_height="96dp"
    android:src="@drawable/profile"
    app:civ_border_width="2dp"
    app:civ_border_color="#FF000000"/>
```
- maven
